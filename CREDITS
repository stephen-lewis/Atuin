Portions of this code are based on the Hazel Game Engine being developed by The Cherno. My thanks to him for the
"Game Engine Series" he has produced. The public repo of Hazel can be found here: https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel and
The Cherno's youtube is here: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject/

Libraries:

spdlog: https://github.com/gabime/spdlog
Use this. It's fast. It's simple. Just use it.

GLFW: https://www.glfw.org
Closest thing to a multiplatform windowing library available. OpenGL & Vulkan integration is nice.
