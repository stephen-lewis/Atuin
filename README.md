# A'tuin Game Project

>Through the fathomless deeps of space swims the star turtle Great A'Tuin, bearing on its back the four giant elephants who carry on their shoulders the mass of the Discworld.  A tiny sun and moon spin around them, on a complicated orbit to induce seasons, so probably nowhere else in the multiverse is it sometimes necessary for an elephant to cock a leg to allow the sun to go past. Exactly why this should be may never be known.  Possibly the Creator of the universe got bored with all the usual business of axial inclination, albedos and rotational velocities, and decided to have a bit of fun for once. -- Terry Pratchett, The Colour of Magic

## Octavo
Octavo is the primary game engine library, containing all key functionality. Currently this is core application functions, a basic renderer and some resource management. This is all work in progress.

## Kvatch
This is the test environment. As Octavo is a static library, it cannot operate on its own. Kvatch is the application built to demonstrate features.
